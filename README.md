# Comparison of feature selection techniques for k-mer data

This repository contains the code used in comparison of existing feature selection methods to determine which of them are the most efficient for the k-mer data.

Notes:
1. To reproduce all the experiments, it is necessary to have access to the data that can be provided upon request.
2. The total computation time exceeds 30 days.
